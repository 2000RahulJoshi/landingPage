# Landing Page Template .....

# Introduction :-
### This is the basic template that I have designed by using html and css without using the flex box property.

# Overview :-
### The template can be divided into three parts :-
1- Navigation bar which contain the logo, Home, Services, Blog, About, FAQ.

2- Left section which contains the information like name,email and a button.

3- Image section which contains some SVG images.


# Clone this repository to your local machine:
run the following command on terminal (inside that folder in which you want to clone the repo):-

git clone https://github.com/2000RahulJoshi/landingPage.git


# Customize the content:
1- Edit the index.html file to modify the content of the landing page.

2- Update the styles in the style.css file to customize the look of the landing page.

3- Open the index.html file in a web browser to preview the landing page.
